Developing Secure IoT triggering mechnisms via Acoustics Triggers 👏. This repo will contain information, code and a kick-ass publication for our amazing Idea!


## Scenario
While benchmarking mobile processors under battery load, a researcher needed to find a method to disconnect phones from chargers prior to benchmarking in an automated fashion. To her dismay, off-the-shelf IoT smart-plug solutions were insecure and do not expose an documented API for DIYers. On the other hand, the undocumented internal API is completely exposed; the cheap IoT smart plugs accept instructions via insecure HTTP POST commands in plain text. USB power relays, on the otherhand offer a solution but are not off-the-shelf and are pretty dangerous to set up for inexperienced users.

The solution? [The Clapper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Clapper) 👏👏. 

## Extensions

### Acoustic Central Processing Unit (A CPU)
Since we are effectively proposing an Acoustic Transistor, we believe that we can group clappers into logic gates and higher level units until we get microprocess. The proposed processor speed will be measured in Beats per Minute (BPM). We expect the processor to produce a sick beat while executing tight computational flows.

### Acoustic Virtual A CPU (A v(A CPU))
Using we can embed the ability to simulate or drive an A CPU using existing IoT devices such as Amazon's Alexa, by insructing Alexa to clap like so:
```
"Alexa, play two claps 👏👏" 
```
