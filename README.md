# acoustic-iot
Developing Secure IoT triggering mechnisms via Acoustics Triggers üëè. This repo will contain information, code and a kick-ass publication for our amazing Idea!


## Scenario
While benchmarking mobile processors under battery load, a researcher needed to find a method to disconnect phones from chargers prior to benchmarking in an automated fashion. To her dismay, off-the-shelf IoT smart-plug solutions were insecure and do not expose an documented API for DIYers. On the other hand, the undocumented internal API is completely exposed; the cheap IoT smart plugs accept instructions via insecure HTTP POST commands in plain text. USB power relays, on the otherhand offer a solution but are not off-the-shelf and are pretty dangerous to set up for inexperienced users.

The solution? [The Clapper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Clapper) üëèüëè. 

## Extensions

### Acoustic Central Processing Unit (A CPU)
Since we are effectively proposing an Acoustic Transistor, we believe that we can group clappers into logic gates and higher level units until we get microprocess. The proposed processor speed will be measured in Beats per Minute (BPM). We expect the processor to produce a sick beat while executing tight computational flows.

### Acoustic Virtual A CPU (A v(A CPU))
Having successfully airgapped our system through the use of acousitic-iot, we are secure in coupling our system to additional subsystems to further alleviate researcher burdon. To this end we can embed the ability to simulate or drive an A CPU using existing IoT devices such as Amazon's Alexa, by insructing Alexa to clap like so:
```
"Alexa, play two claps üëèüëè" 
```

### Exploration of Intersectional IoT and ASoTV Ideation

In future work we would like to explore the security possibilities found in the rich intersection between internet of things devices and as seen on tv technologies (M4TV). Despite the potentially off-putting or campy nature found in ASoTV technologies, we believe that these devices have a valuable utility not present in other state of the art IoT subsystems as they tend to be cheap, highly available, and resiliant to all computer-based attacks. While it is not entirely clear from this juncture what types of IoT applications will be found for products such as "the egg sitter" or "the lizard cam", we are confidident that future research will continue to flush out this burgeoning space.
